Product Specification: AI-Powered Job Application Autofill Chrome Extension
1. Product Overview

This Chrome extension helps job seekers apply to roles faster and with higher-quality answers.
It automatically parses any online job application form, extracts questions, and generates tailored, high-quality answers using the user’s CV or LinkedIn profile + their personal writing style.
