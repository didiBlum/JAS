# Extension Icons TODO

The extension needs icons in the following sizes:
- 16x16 (toolbar icon)
- 48x48 (extension management)
- 128x128 (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Workaround

For development, you can:
1. Create simple placeholder images
2. Use an online icon generator
3. Use a design tool like Figma/Canva

## Suggested Design

- Icon should represent "AI + Forms" or "Auto-fill"
- Consider: 📄✨, 🤖📋, or similar
- Colors: Blue (#2563EB) and white for professional look

## Files Needed

Place these files in the `extension/` directory:
- `icon16.png`
- `icon48.png`
- `icon128.png`

Update `manifest.json` icons section once files are ready.
